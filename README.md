# Website description

## Purpose 

We were approached by the owner of Sakura Company, a Japanese food wholesaler, to create an online store for Japanese food products.

The web app serves three main purposes: 
- To promote and increase access to Japanese food. 
- To provide a service to the Japanese community in Australia and to those who love Japanese food products. 
- To contribute to business and sales growth for the client, Sakura Company.

**Problem** 

Prior to having the website, the primary means of obtaining Japanese food was through Japanese supermarkets, mainly located in central areas. This posed geographical constraints for those living in the suburbs. Moreover, limited store numbers and early closing times, often by 5pm, made it challenging for full-time workers to visit. Setting up a physical shop also presented a significant hurdle for Sakura Company, especially with rising rents due to recent unforeseen inflation.

**Solution**

The launch of Sakura Pantry is envisioned to address these challenges. Sakura Pantry is an easy-to-use platform for purchasing Japanese food products, accessible to both city dwellers and those in the suburbs, operating 24/7. Unrestricted by the number of shops or closing times, it offers the convenience of online shopping, catering to the busy full-time workforce. By avoiding the need for physical shops, it provides a more cost-efficient means for Sakura Company to offer Japanese food products. In doing so, Sakura Pantry introduces a modern solution to access Japanese food ingredients in response to contemporary demands.


## Target Audience

The app targets shoppers across Australia who are looking for unique and quality Japanese food products, including:

- Japanese people residing in Australia
- Japanese food products lovers

## User Stories 
We construct user stories and personas to improve the online store's user experience for Japanese food products. The process involves identifying and embodying potential users' unique needs and expectations, including a system administrator at Sakura company.

A problem Shizuka faces is the difficulty travelling to supermarkets where authentic Japanese food products are available, even with her three children. With the demands of raisingtrello  her children, she also needs to save time when shopping for her daily food. She is particularly concerned about the security of websites, especially when shopping online, and prefers to use sites that offer a secure login facility.

On the other hand, Ronnie, a user who has recently become addicted to Japanese food, also faces difficulties in finding Japanese foodstuffs locally. Ronnie is also an engineer. The engineer, Ronnie, also expects the system's ease of use and accessibility to the information required.

The final user story focuses on Lara, a system administrator at Sakura Company. She aims to ensure efficient operations and deliver the best user experience. High-quality user and product inventory management are essential to achieve this goal. The system is expected to be intuitive, easy to understand, and provide easy access to crucial functions.
